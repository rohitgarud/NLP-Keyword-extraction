    "Keyword extraction is a natural language processing technique that automatically identifies the most important words and phrases in a document. It is used to extract the most relevant words and phrases that summarize the main themes of the text. These words and phrases can be used as index terms or tags to help classify and organize the text, and can also be used as input to other NLP tasks such as text summarization or information retrieval."

    "The basic idea behind TF-IDF is that words that appear frequently in a document are likely to be more important to the meaning of that document than words that appear less frequently. However, it also takes into account that some words, such as \"the\" or \"and\", appear frequently across many documents, and therefore shouldn't be given as much weight as words that appear less frequently in the corpus. This is where the \"IDF\" component comes in, which down-weights words that appear in many documents. "
